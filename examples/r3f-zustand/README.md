# examples/r3f-zustand

This is an example of an orbit camera controller in react-three-fiber,
using Zustand for state management.

You can also import `Controls` as a library:

```js
import {
  Controls,
  useCamera,
  updateCamera,
  useCameraConfig,
  updateCameraConfig
} from `control-kit/examples/r3f-zustand/src/Controls`
```

**Note:** Changes to `Controls` must follow semver!
